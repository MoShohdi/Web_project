        <p>
            Our Education Support Initiative focuses on giving every child the opportunity to learn and grow. 
            Through after-school tutoring, school supply donations, and mentorship programs, we help students 
            build confidence and reach their academic goals.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2025, our volunteers worked with over 150 students to provide learning materials, 
            guidance, and support for their education. We believe that education is the key to breaking 
            the cycle of poverty and building a brighter future for all children.
        </p>

        <p>
            This project is made possible through the help of local schools, teachers, and community partners 
            who share our passion for empowering young learners.
